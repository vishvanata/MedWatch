# MedWatch
MedWatch is a remote patient monitoring system. Utilized AWS IoT, Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis Firehose, S3, and QuickSight to handle, store, and visualize incoming medical sensor data which was simulated using AWS Boto3 Python package and AWS CLI. Throughout this project I used S3 lifecycle policies to handle archiving of data and IAM roles to allocate just enough permissions for AWS resources.
